<h1>Breakout</h1>
<p>This is a WIP far from finished. There are bugs, this is just for early feedback</p>
<p>This work is entirely my own. All code, and all assets. Don't be a scumbag, don't plagurize <3 </p>
<h2> Controls </h2>
<ul><li>Mouse to move paddle</li>
  <li>Right Click to spawn a ball</li>
</ul>
<p>Score is multiplied by the amount of active balls. Go on, make the game harder for yourself</p>
<br>
<p> One known bug: CTD can occur if you allow the ball to spawn under bricks. Easily avoided, will be fixed by new feature in next build.</p>
